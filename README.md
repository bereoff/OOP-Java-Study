# Key Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming

This project represents a study during my undergraduate program in the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course, using the Java language.

It was an interesting course that introduced me to the key concepts of OOP, including:
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Abstraction
* Polymorphism
